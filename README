What needs work:
Unicode support for the whole bot needs to be incorporated.
socketHandler.py crashes when connection breaks unexpectedly. 
Code for connecting to server, joining a channel, and /nick, ghosting, etc need cleaning up
A little better error handling for command functions (errors should be dealt with in ircBot.py)


Things that need to be done down the road.
Allow for bot to be on multiple channels -- each with their own configuration.
Allow for multiple servers.
